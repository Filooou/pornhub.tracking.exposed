<div class="randomActive"></div>

<div class="radarContainer" >
    Each radius represents one of the categories of the video watched â€• pick random users or access to your personal page by using the <a href="/pov">browser extension</a>.
    <div class="radarChart" style="text-align: center;"></div>
</div>

The distance from the center of the point marked on the radius is given by the percentage of the times in which the categories appear. The points on the rays are joined with segments, so that the graph takes on a personal shape. This shape can tell us something about user profiling, radicalization and which are the categories most connected to each other.
