# Pornhub and amateur exploitation


Pornhub mix a dynamic of a pseudo-social network, where independent content producer meets buyers. People connects attracted by social and sexual dynamics, but in the homepage you'll but their attention get split in three chunks: Pornography dying industry (37%), Algoritmic experiment (25%), Verified models (37%).


_Verified Models_ it is a metric they love to report and count, as long as it goes high, becuase is meant to let you belive* the platform is healthy.
* it might be even true that _Verified Models_ counter keep growing, but we can't fully trust Year in Review because that's marketing and not Open Data.


attract watcher attention, uses 'verified models' as a way to build a pseudo-social network 
Pornhub uses many of the addictive feature of social networks to keep people coming back more frequently. In the Insight, the new 'Verified Models' is always an important measure because disply how many new content producer join the network and implicitly give relevance to their content.

Verified model keep growing, 
Porn production companies is not, it is a dying industry, and pornhub is using the homepage as a way to push them and profit as content distributor. How?






We start to study PornHub algorith in 2019, by reusing the same technology we built to study Youtube algorithmn.

    <p>Pornhub is all about getting dirty, and so are we. But when it comes to the millions of tons of waste that wash up on our shores each year, we could all stand to clean up our act. That’s why we teamed up with them to create The Dirtiest Porn Ever: An adult film shot on one of the most polluted beaches in the world. And to help clean it up… we want you to get down and dirty. For every view of this video, Pornhub will make a donation to Ocean Polymers to help them in their efforts to help preserve our oceans and beaches.

I'm sure there are more precise calcultation and we are not considering the additional impact caused by HD streaming and mobile networks.

## Avbout this page (Review ok)

We believe Pornhub Insight Year Review is a promotional action that looks like a form of data transparency. That is not open data that do not talk about Pornhub but talks about making you feel ok regarding pornhub consumption. Also, to clarify our intention: we are sex friendly, so we want to expose pornhub's subtle communication behavior; this is not sexuality, but perception exploitation.
