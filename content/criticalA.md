# The algorithm and the amateur bait

{{<pocrit

    lefttitle="— By giving space to independent creator, PornHub redirect users' attention to sell their own products. Look how much"
    rightcontent="People connects attracted by social and sexual dynamics, but in the homepage you'll but their attention get split in three chunks: Pornography dying industry (37%), Algoritmic experiment (25%), Verified models (37%)."
    textstyle="font-size:2em"
>}}

### Pornhub mixes the dynamic of a pseudo-social network, where independent content producer meets buyers; The reason why they give so much attention to the new verified amateurs, is because they are the cheapest way to attract new visitors.

The non-verified content uploaders are meaningful for two reasons: historically, pornhub republished content shoot by others to attract visitors, and now they delegate this task to a community of random contributors that, for their reason, want to get visibility in their platform. Second, when an original content producer offers their recordings, they should get feedback from the watchers to feel integrated and appreciated even if they have a low roster. Perhaps, in PH hopes, they become "verified models."

# The woman market

Woman count for more than the half of world population, and would be a large market loss for PornHub if their consumption seems to be only for man. In the Yearly review there is always a mention and their presence is _constantly growing_.

* in [2019 they said 32%](https://www.pornhub.com/insights/2019-year-in-review#gender), [2018 = 29%](https://www.pornhub.com/insights/2018-year-in-review#gender), [2017 = 26%](https://www.pornhub.com/insights/2017-year-in-review), [2016 = 26%](https://www.pornhub.com/insights/2016-year-in-review), [2015 = 24%](https://www.pornhub.com/insights/pornhub-2015-year-in-review),
* in [2014 was 23%](https://www.pornhub.com/insights/2014-year-in-review),
* in [2013 there was not MindGeek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MindGeek), the company owning PornHub had the name **MANWIN**, which as you can guess might not sound very inclusive. in October the name changed and so the rebrainding started. It is not an evidence, but this whole woman friendliness to us sounds like a marketing strategy.

# ... How inaccurate is the woman count? 

Considering

1. Pornhub delegated the gender-attribution to Google Analytics, so, Google keep track of your PH activity and you see if there is any trace in your 
2. By a preliminary experiment run by us, if an user without previous activities watch a lesbian video would be likely counted as woman

I'm sure there are more precise calcultation and we are not considering the additional impact caused by HD streaming and mobile networks. Please if you have more correct estimation let us know, we are following [this enviromental assessment](https://www.carbonbrief.org/factcheck-what-is-the-carbon-footprint-of-streaming-video-on-netflix); At 720p one hour of streaming is 1.8 gigabyte.

## About this page

We believe Pornhub Insight Year Review is a promotional action that looks like a form of data transparency. That is not open data that do not talk about Pornhub but talks about making you feel ok regarding pornhub consumption. Also, to clarify our intention: we are sex friendly, so we want to expose pornhub's subtle communication behavior; this is not sexuality, but perception exploitation.


## About the project (still not reviewed)

[pornhub.tracking.exposed](/preview) is a browser extension that let you scrape personalized content that PornHub deliver to you. We built it so we can use it to organize collaborative observations, and to stay update please follow us on twitter, facebook, or join our mattermost channel.

## leftover texts

_Verified Models_ it is a metric they love to report and count, as long as it goes high, becuase is meant to let you belive* the platform is healthy.
* it might be even true that _Verified Models_ counter keep growing, but we can't fully trust Year in Review because that's marketing and not Open Data.

of course the amateur producer are happy about that: but, sorry, they can have more. we envison a future in which they might get 100% of the pie and don't be subject to corporate hidden policies.

attract watcher attention, uses 'verified models' as a way to build a pseudo-social network 
Pornhub uses many of the addictive feature of social networks to keep people coming back more frequently. In the Insight, the new 'Verified Models' is always an important measure because disply how many new content producer join the network and implicitly give relevance to their content.

Verified model keep growing, 
Porn production companies is not, it is a dying industry, and pornhub is using the homepage as a way to push them and profit as content distributor. How?
