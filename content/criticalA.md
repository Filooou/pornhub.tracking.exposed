From an external independent source, as it should be.

# Algorithm and Amateur bait

{{<pocrit
    leftId="homepage--stats"
    lefttitle="— By giving space to independent creators, PornHub redirects users' attention to sell their own products. Look how much"
    rightcontent="People connect attracted by social and sexual dynamics, but in the homepage their attention get split in three chunks: Pornography dying industry (37%), Algoritmic experiment (25%), Verified models (37%)."
    textstyle="font-size:2em"
>}}

### Pornhub mixes the dynamic of a pseudo-social network, where independent content producers meet buyers. The reason they give so much attention to the new Verified Amateurs is because they are the *cheapest* way to attract new visitors.

The non-verified content uploaders are meaningful for two reasons: historically, Pornhub republished content shooted by others to attract visitors, and now they delegate this task to a community of random contributors who also want to get visibility in the platform. Second, when an original content producer offers recordings, they should get feedback from the watchers to feel integrated and appreciated, even if they have a low roster. Perhaps, in PH hopes, they'll become "verified models."

# Insight is the new advertising

Pornhub produces "Insights", that are actually a wall of text full of statistics where he incense himself. Journalist worldwide speak about them, without being too obvious that there is nothing about journalism, just advertising.
Indeed: an *Insight* in marketing terms is what that a company applies in order to make a product or brand more appealing to customers.
We'd like to propose a different approch. People do the numbers. Companies are unfit to evaluate themself, for obvious reasons of conflict interest.

### "Innkeeper, how's the wine?"

### "Good, my wine is always good..."

PH dont seems to be very comfortable with communication theory, so we'd like to help.

For example in their 2017 insight, PH pokes Marshall McLuhan and his theory: “the medium is the message” to pretend that they're investigating on media where porn is made available, discovering that is a smartphone.. We enjoy correct them: the medium where the porn is carried here, is pornhub. Plain and simple.

What Professor McLuhan has suggested, is that information is no longer an instrument for producing economic merchandise, but has itself become the chief merchandise. We found amusing that PH mention his work without realizing how it would backfire.

# Greenwashing the dirty secrets

PH does greenwashing. Let's expose that. With numbers.

Unlike peer-to-peer for instance, a streaming portal like PH consumes CO2 because it provides new content every time, repeatedly.
We understand that this has made the use more comfortable and makes you cum in less time, but let's remember that streaming pollutes and less time means less pleasure. 

{{<pocrit
    leftpict="/images/dirtiest-porn-ever.jpeg"
    lefttitle="— In 2020 PH produced “The Dirtiest Porn Ever”, as part of a campaign against pollution."
    hover="#dirtiest-porn-info"
    rightcontent="In 2019 Pornhub streaming (only) produced 1.4 million tons of CO2. Equivalent to 0,3 coal-fired power plants in one year. The same amount of greenhouse gas is avoid also by recycling 56.584.941 trash bags — a bit more than what we saw in the video! That CO2 can be absorbed by 21.989.505 trees in 10 years."
    textstyle="font-size:2em"

<div hidden class="pocrit--loaded" id="dirtiest-porn-info">
    <h4>(their description)</h4>
    <p>Pornhub is all about getting dirty, and so are we. But when it comes to the millions of tons of waste that wash up on our shores each year, we could all stand to clean up our act. That’s why we teamed up with them to create The Dirtiest Porn Ever: An adult film shot on one of the most polluted beaches in the world. And to help clean it up… we want you to get down and dirty. For every view of this video, Pornhub will make a donation to Ocean Polymers to help them in their efforts to help preserve our oceans and beaches.

_Source_: we are using the conservative evaluation that 0.4 Kg of Co2 per hour of streaming. I'm sure there are more precise calcultation and we are not considering the additional impact caused by HD streaming and mobile networks. Please if you have more correct estimation let us know, we are following [this enviromental assessment](https://www.carbonbrief.org/factcheck-what-is-the-carbon-footprint-of-streaming-video-on-netflix); At 720p one hour of streaming is 1.8 gigabyte.

### Porn for women or women for porn? 

It is not very clear to us the obsession Pornhub has for women ;)
PH basically sells a product for the male gaze. Where women and female sexuality are poorly representend.
Why Insights push so hard on women's statistics? And how do he know that: in that region 2% of woman more tha last year?
Google analytics? Please. Pretty please. The veridicy of that data is debatable.

###(If you want to know what women thinks and want, just ask them. Stop exploit them. That simple.)

Women count for more than the half of world population, and would be a large market loss and bad advertising for PornHub if men only were watching contents. In the yearly review there is always a mention and their presence is _constantly growing_.

* in [2019 they said 32%](https://www.pornhub.com/insights/2019-year-in-review#gender), [2018 = 29%](https://www.pornhub.com/insights/2018-year-in-review#gender), [2017 = 26%](https://www.pornhub.com/insights/2017-year-in-review), [2016 = 26%](https://www.pornhub.com/insights/2016-year-in-review), [2015 = 24%](https://www.pornhub.com/insights/pornhub-2015-year-in-review),
* in [2014 was 23%](https://www.pornhub.com/insights/2014-year-in-review),
* in [2013 there was not MindGeek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MindGeek), the company owning PornHub had the name **MANWIN**, which as you can guess might not sound very inclusive. in October the name changed and so the rebrainding started. It is not an evidence, but this whole woman friendliness also sounds like a marketing strategy.

### ... How inaccurate is the woman count? 

Considering that:

1. Pornhub delegated the gender-attribution to Google Analytics, so, Google keeps track of your PH activity and you sees if there is any trace in your.
2. By a preliminary experiment run by us, if an user without previous activities watch a lesbian video would be likely counted as a woman.

## About this page

We believe Pornhub Insight Year Review is a promotional action that looks like a form of data transparency. That is not open data that do not talk about Pornhub but talks about making you feel ok regarding pornhub consumption. Also, to clarify our intention: we are sex friendly, so we want to expose pornhub's subtle communication behavior; this is not sexuality, but perception exploitation.


## About the project (still not reviewed)

[pornhub.tracking.exposed](/preview) is a browser extension that permits you to scrape personalized content that PornHub delivers to you. We built it so we can use it to organize collaborative observations.

## leftover texts

_Verified Models_ it is a metric they love to report and count, as long as it goes high, becuase is meant to let you belive* the platform is healthy.
* it might be even true that _Verified Models_ counter keep growing, but we can't fully trust Year in Review because that's marketing and not Open Data.

of course the amateur producer are happy about that: but, sorry, they can have more. we envison a future in which they might get 100% of the pie and don't be subject to corporate hidden policies.

attract watcher attention, uses 'verified models' as a way to build a pseudo-social network 
Pornhub uses many of the addictive feature of social networks to keep people coming back more frequently. In the Insight, the new 'Verified Models' is always an important measure because disply how many new content producer join the network and implicitly give relevance to their content.

Verified model keep growing, 
Porn production companies is not, it is a dying industry, and pornhub is using the homepage as a way to push them and profit as content distributor. How?
