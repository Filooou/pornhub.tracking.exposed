# Warning: methodology review in progress!

The test would be likely organized to: **test the gay section of PornHub**, which is the truly stigmatized section!, and **verify our first findings**. _Probable sequence_:

* watch homepage
* watch recommended
* watch a video belonging to fetish X, published 24 hours before
* watch a video belonging to fetish X, published 7 days before
* watch a video belonging to fetish X, published 2 months before
* watch a video belonging to fetish X, published 1 year before
* watch a video belonging to fetish X, published 5 years before
* watch recommended
* watch homepage

## Why designed this way?

Research questions: 
* **is pornhub gay the same of pornhub straight?**
* **is true video freezes their recommendations after a while?**
* **how many videos PH needs to poulate your recommendation page if you display interest on a peculiar kind of fetish?**.
