# POV

+ Homemade pornography has been made possible by the technological advances of cameras, video cameras and mobile phones, but it’s the web that has allowed its distribution in an endemic way. The World Wide Web was the first computer technology that as main component of its value proposition had the mainstream adoption of pornography.

+ Because of the puritanical face of the mainstream internet, porn has been largely excluded from traditional marketing, often developing in a separate universe, with business models that changed and advanced at exponential speed compared to the traditional market, on an anarcho-liberal model. Parallelisms with other social media can stimulate lateral and critical thinking.

+ Sensitive data on site visits and therefore onanistic acts have now become, for companies like google and facebook, one of the parameters that define the uniqueness of a user, and somehow also characterize an entire community.

+ The task of create culture around technology and in emotional and sex education, to form free individuals with thinking skills and independent judgment, must not be delegated to any Silicon Valley’s company, from Pornhub to other technological giants, which, with the aim of improving advertising and/or acquiring greater prestige, occasionally spectacularize and exploit values what we have forgotten should be the pillars of our human aggregates.

+ The economy that deal with big data and its strategies, such as user profiling and personalized suggestions, address society towards an anarcho-capitalist model of free theft, surveillance and command. The meaning is no longer the one built by the community, but the one suggested by the virtual machines that look for correlations between one immeasurable amount of data, something that can be manipulated to prove any hypothesis. What apparently seems a scientific evidence, actually derives from highly ideological assumptions.

+ The debate on pornography is still present within the feminist movement and beyond, to have more study and analysis tools can only be positive: censorship and silence are nothing but obstacles to growth, legacies of old traditions and repressive habits.

+ Algorithms can organize information in our best interest or not. Awareness in users needs to be motivated for their own interest, for a safe, sane and consensual relationship with technology.
