    <p>Pornhub is all about getting dirty, and so are we. But when it comes to the millions of tons of waste that wash up on our shores each year, we could all stand to clean up our act. That‚Äôs why we teamed up with them to create The Dirtiest Porn Ever: An adult film shot on one of the most polluted beaches in the world. And to help clean it up‚Ä¶ we want you to get down and dirty. For every view of this video, Pornhub will make a donation to Ocean Polymers to help them in their efforts to help preserve our oceans and beaches.

Unlike peer-to-peer for instance, a streaming portal like PH consumes CO2 because it provides new content every time, repeatedly üíî We understand that this has made the use more comfortable and makes you cum in less time, but let's remember that streaming pollutes and less time means less pleasure.

# Porn for women or women for porn? 

{{<pocrit
    leftId="women--stats"
    lefttitle="‚Äî PornHub obsession for women is not just as subject, also as consumer"
    rightcontent="PH basically sells a product for the male gaze. Where women and female sexuality are poorly representend. Why Insights push so hard on women's statistics?"
    textstyle="font-size:2em"
>}}

### (If you want to know what women thinks and want, just ask them. Stop exploit them. That simple.)

Women count for more than the half of world population, and would be a large market loss and bad advertising for PornHub if men only were watching contents. In the yearly review there is always a mention and their presence is _constantly growing_. Even in nations where internet is accessible mostly by man, even when a country has a +20% spike on connected people, pornhub tell us there is this organic grow. Constantly.

### Smell like bias (if good faith is assumed), and this is our critical-insight:

1. Pornhub delegated the gender-attribution to Google Analytics, so, Google keeps track of your PH activity and you sees if there is any trace in your.

2. By a preliminary experiment run by us, **if an user that is not profiled** watch a lesbian video would be likely counted as a woman.

3. Every person navigating in incognito that watch, for example a lesbian video (but others categories might be more statistically bugged) might be measured as a woman, regardless their actual gender!

# Pornhub and the (lack of) consent 

In December 2020 [strong actions from payment network](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pornhub-mastercard/mastercard-to-stop-processing-payments-on-pornhub-cites-unlawful-content-idUSKBN28K30C) was a reaction to [a NYT piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/04/opinion/sunday/pornhub-rape-trafficking.html), [and more](https://static.nytimes.com/email-content/NK_sample.html). We were working on these insight before [PornHub issued a formal response and a policy change](https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/categories/360002934613). By monitoring before and after, we can go point by point in saying what's actually changed in the platform, but we want to focus on

### We argue the change of PornHub are mostly cosmetic, why?

<span style="font-size:4em"> TO BE COMPLETED</span>

# Insight is not open stats, is the new advertising

Pornhub produces "Year in Review", among many others, that are actually a wall of graph full of statistics where they celebrate their business. Journalist worldwide speak about them, without being too obvious that there is nothing about journalism, but unpaid advertising made to tickle sexual curiosity.

Indeed: an *Insight* in marketing terms is what that a company applies in order to make a product or brand more appealing to customers.
We'd like to propose a different approch. People do the numbers. Companies are unfit to evaluate themself, for obvious reasons of conflict interest.

### PH dont seems to be very comfortable with communication theory, so we'd like to help.

For example in their 2017 insight, PH pokes Marshall McLuhan and his theory: ‚Äúthe medium is the message‚Äù to pretend that they're investigating on media where porn is made available, discovering that is a smartphone.. We enjoy correct them: **the medium where the porn is carried here, is pornhub**. _Is the policy in the platform, allowing every kind of content to be uploaded, ignoring complaing on abusive material, using algorithms that test appeal of videos by showing them to random watcher._

What Professor McLuhan has suggested, is that information is no longer an instrument for producing economic merchandise, but has itself become the chief merchandise. We found amusing that PH mention his work without realizing how it would backfire ü§∑.

#### Pornhub mixes the dynamic of a pseudo-social network, where independent content producers meet buyers. The reason they give so much attention to the new Verified Amateurs is because they are the *cheapest* way to attract new visitors.

The non-verified content uploaders are pushed in homepage so strongly, compared to other platforms like YouTube, for two reasons:

1. Historically, Pornhub republished content shooted by others to attract visitors, and now they delegate this task to a community of random contributors who also want to get visibility in the platform.

2. When an original content producer offers recordings, they should get feedback from the watchers to feel integrated and appreciated, even if they have a low roster. Perhaps, in PH hopes, they'll become "verified amateurs" and thus engagin more in the social dynamics, let fan comeback more often, and serve them the 37% from the dying pron industry (which is kept alive and profitable only by PornHub infrastructure and visibility), and the 25% as part of their automated experiments.


#### On the women stats

* in [2019 they said 32%](https://www.pornhub.com/insights/2019-year-in-review#gender), [2018 = 29%](https://www.pornhub.com/insights/2018-year-in-review#gender), [2017 = 26%](https://www.pornhub.com/insights/2017-year-in-review), [2016 = 26%](https://www.pornhub.com/insights/2016-year-in-review), [2015 = 24%](https://www.pornhub.com/insights/pornhub-2015-year-in-review),
* in [2014 was 23%](https://www.pornhub.com/insights/2014-year-in-review),
* in [2013 there was not MindGeek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MindGeek), the company owning PornHub had the name **MANWIN**, which as you can guess might not sound very inclusive. in October the name changed and so the rebrainding started. It is not an evidence, but this whole women friendliness also sounds like a marketing strategy.


#### On the enviromental impact calculation

We are using the conservative evaluation that 0.4 Kg of Co2 per hour of streaming. I'm sure there are more precise calcultation and we are not considering the additional impact caused by HD streaming and mobile networks. Please if you have more correct estimation let us know, we are following [this enviromental assessment](https://www.carbonbrief.org/factcheck-what-is-the-carbon-footprint-of-streaming-video-on-netflix); At 720p one hour of streaming is 1.8 gigabyte. [calculation](https://twitter.com/_vecna/status/1335273018013196298?s=20); (If you are interested on the subject, [try this out](https://codecarbon.io/).
